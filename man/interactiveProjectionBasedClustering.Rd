Interactive Projection-Based Clustering  of [Thrun et al., 2020]
}
\description{
  An interactive clustering tool using the topographic map visualizations of the generalized U-matrix and a variety of different projection methods. This function receives a dataset and starts a shiny interface where one is able to choose a projection method and generate a plot.ly visualization of the topograhpic map [Thrun et al., 2016] of the generalized U-matrix [Ultsch/Thrun, 2017] combined with projected points. It includes capabilities for interactive clustering within the interface and automatic projection-based clustering based on [Thrun/Ultsch, 2020].
}
\usage{
  interactiveProjectionBasedClustering(Data, Cls=NULL )
}
\arguments{
  \item{Data}{
    The dataset [1:n,1:d] of n cases and d vriables with which the U-matrix and the projection will be calculated.
  }
  \item{Cls}{
     Optional: Prior Classification of the data for the [1:n] cases of k classes.
  }
}
\details{
Cls is a numerical vector of the length n (number of cases) with the integer elements of numbers from 1 to k if k is the number of groups in the data.
Each element of Cls as an unambigous mapping to a case of Data indicating by the rownames of Data. If Data has no rownames a vector from 1:n is generated and then Cls is named by it.
}
\value{
Returns a List of:
  \item{Cls}{[1:n] numerical vector of the clustering of the dataset for then cases of k clusters}
  \item{Plot}{The final plot generated by plot.ly when closing the tool}
  \item{Umatrix}{
 [1:Lines,1:Columns] Umatrix to be plotted, numerical matrix storing the U-heights, see [Thrun, 2018] for definition.
}
\item{Bestmatches}{
[1:n,2]   GridConverted Projected Points information converted by convertProjectionProjectedPoints() to predefined Grid by Lines and Columns
}
